# FPGA  *(Feild Programable Gate Arrays)*
## Starting Place 
1. HDL Simulation Software 
    - [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/vivado.html) - [Download](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)
      | Advantages | Disadvantages |
      | ---------- | ------------- |
      | The basic version is free to use | Not supported on macOS |
      | Supports VHDL, Verilog and SystemVerilog | Only limited support for VHDL-2008 |
      | Easy to view waveforms in GUI | Difficult to use verification libraries such as OSVVM or UVM |
      |  | Typically requires large install. |
